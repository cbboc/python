Python version of CBBOC

## Run Instructions
In order to finish in a timely manner, we plan to use PyPy version 2.2.1 to run all Python submissions. If you're code does not work with that version of PyPy, you must 1) Mention it in your submission email and 2) Take alternative measures to ensure code efficiency.

To run the example Simulated Annealing algorithm, call the following from the "src" directory:

`pypy SAHHCompetitor.py`

Note: For sample1 (the default) this will require approximately 1 hour to produce results.

To change problem classes, edit resources/classFolder.txt to contain the relative path to the problem class folder.

See the competition website for more details.
